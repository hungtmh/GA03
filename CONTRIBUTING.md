# Contributing Guidelines

Thank you for contributing to this project!  
Please follow the guidelines below to keep our workflow clean and consistent.

---

## 1. Branching Workflow
- Always **create a new branch** from `main` before starting a new task.
- Branch name format:
feature/short-description
fix/short-description

Example:
feature/login-page
fix/navbar-bug


- After finishing your task:
- Push your branch to GitHub.
- Create a **Pull Request (PR)** to merge it into `main`.
- Delete the branch after merging to avoid clutter.

---

## 2. Pull Requests (PR)
- Every PR must be **reviewed by at least 1 team member** before merging.
- Do not merge directly into `main`.
- Test your changes carefully before opening a PR.
- Keep PRs small and focused on a single task or feature.

---

## 3. Commit Message Convention
Use the following format for commit messages:

type: short description

Examples:
feat(Hung): add login page
fix(Cuong): fix API returning 404
style(Khoa): update header color
refactor(Khai): optimize Navbar component
docs(Thang): update README

**Allowed types:**
| Type       | Meaning                                |
|------------|------------------------------------------|
| feat       | New feature                             |
| fix        | Bug fix                                 |
| docs       | Documentation updates                   |
| style      | UI or formatting changes                |
| refactor   | Code restructuring without new features |
| test       | Add or modify tests                     |
| chore      | Miscellaneous tasks (config, cleanup…)  |

## 4. Code Review

- Check functionality before approving.

---

## 5. Communication
- Discuss big changes with the team **before coding**.
- Use commit and PR messages in **English** for consistency.
- Keep messages clear and concise.
